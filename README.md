# stringsutils
This is a strings utility package developed in Golang.

It containers two public functions: Upper() & Lower()

## How to use
The input for both functions is one string and the output is also one string.

The upper function turns any string into all capital letters.
```
Upper('hello')
// output -> HELLO
```

The lower function turns any string into all lower letters.
```
Upper('HELLO')
// output -> hello
```
